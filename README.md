# About
A repository containing the algorithm and the idea summary of the  Challenge@Polito_By Students "New Opportunities from Autonomous and Connected Mobility". This is part of a 6-person team project aimed at finding an innotive start up idea in the field of CAVs.
The idea is to exploit camera and accelerometers sensors,already available inside an autonomous car to gather information regarding bridge's health while crossing it and deliver this data to local authorities to prevent collapsing of the bridge.
Two approaches were proposed:
- *Image Analysis*: using the camera sensor mounted on the car and positioned facing the terrain of the bridge, while crossing it, we gather data and use a ML algorithm to classify if images contain cracks or not.
- *Dynamic Analysis*: use the accelerometers to measure the natural frequency of the bridge, considering irregularities and vibrations.
